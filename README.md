# KneeJointAngleMDPIRepository

Authors: Obradović Saša, Stančin Sara

The repository for all of the software and measurement data used in the MDPI journal article: "Inertial measurement units' reliability for measuring knee joint angle during road cycling".

Please keep in mind that the implemented error-state Kalman filter requires the MATLAB Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox.

Once the repository has been cloned, simply open scrMain.mlx MATLAB live script and follow the instructions within it. 

The scripts were written in MATLAB Version 9.11.0.1837725 (R2021b) Update 2, and tested on macOS 13.1 Ventura on a MacBook Pro 14 M1 Pro (2021).
